            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system is the main repo for all the project/working files. In your team, the people involved can make changes and commit them. It makes the issue of trying to share files much easier to manage. The Versioning Control System can do things like keep track of who changes the files, what date/time they were changed, what was new compared to the old version and it can combine changes made to the same file. The cool thing about Versioning Control System is that the files cannot be overwritten, there’s one local repo that keeps a copy of all the newest files, everyone can work on it together, and if needed due to an emergency you can switch back to an older version of the project. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As defined in the notes / slides Git is defined as, “a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.” The benefits of Git involve it being very easy to use and understand is also very quick with its performance. It’s better than other SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase as noted in the slides. Some other benefits of GIT involve the fact that everything is local so you don’t have to worry about one point of failure, and the processes run much faster. Also, if you accidentally try and overwrite a program, Git won’t allow that and will prevent it.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">While using Git, there are three very basic commands that are used by everyone and are easy to remember as well as being self-explanatory. The three commands are: add, commit, and push. In the slides the three basic steps were explained using a diagram. The work is sent to the index, also known as the staging area, and is then committed to the local repository (.git) and then pushed to the remote repo. While that is happening a copy of the original file is sent back to the local repo for safe keeping. The files that were sent to the remote repo are now fetched to the original project and you can keep working on it and that’s how the files stay connected to the original source and are sent to be changed when needed.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">History of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In one of the articles we had to read, “A Short History of Git”, we learned about where Git came from. My favorite part was how they said Git started with “a bit of creative destruction and fiery controversy.” Git has been around for eleven years and has grown tremendously into the helpful and easy to use program we use today. When Git was created it was made keeping these goals in mind: to be fast, have a basic design but being able to handle big files like other software tools could but with even better speed and efficiency, and be able to be accessed by anyone who wanted to use the software. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is one of the coolest websites / software tools I’ve gotten to use so far since I’ve started using code. It’s a very easy site to use and maneuver through and is easy to understand. This website is the biggest host for Git repositories and is used by a lot of people. The registration as well as connecting it to my Cloud 9 account were very easy to do. Also, they have options for different types of accounts you can use and it’s very beneficial that they offer a free one to people like me who simply need it for school.</p>
